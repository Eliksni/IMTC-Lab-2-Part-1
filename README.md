# IMTC-Lab-2-Part-1
This repo contains both parts for the lab, despite being called only part 1

## Part 1
For part 1, I added two extra buttons and modified one to toggle all three windmills on and off, and the second to trigger both crossings.

## Part 2
For the second part I mapped all player functionality to the left controller, and all drone functionality to the right controller. More information is given in the PDF where I compare my control scheme to other students.

Below are the two youtube links showing part 1 and 2 of the project.

Additionally, the document comparing other APK's and mine for part two is provided in the root of the repo.
